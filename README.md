In Visual Studio Code, you crafted a sign-up form using HTML, providing a straightforward user interface for account creation on GitHub. The form is structured within a <div> element with the class signup-form, which includes a header, labels, and input fields for username, email, and password, along with a submit button.

Key Features:
HTML Structure: The form is enclosed within a <form> element that specifies an action URL for GitHubâ€™s signup endpoint and uses the POST method for data submission.
CSS Styling: Internal CSS styles the form, centering it on the page and giving it a professional look with padding, background color, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow.
Form Elements:
Labels: Each input field is paired with a corresponding <label> element for accessibility.
Input Fields: The form includes <input> elements for username, email, and password, each marked as required to ensure that users fill out all necessary information before submission.
Submit Button: A <button> element styled for prominence allows users to submit their details to create an account.
Usage:
Open VSCode: Launch Visual Studio Code.
Create New File: Save a new file with an .html extension, e.g., signup.html.
Write HTML Code: Include the HTML and CSS code to define the form structure and styling.
Save and Preview: Save the file and open it in a web browser to view the form
